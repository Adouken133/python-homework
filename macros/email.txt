Dear proffessor:
               This is Katherine,in the matter of fact that i would 
               really like to attend the class. Since lots of things happened recently, i would like to sincerely tell you the truth.
               i got a slight poisoned by carbon monoxide in my apartment since last 2 months. The Freon of the air conditioner in my room has been slightly leak the carbon monoxide 
               in my room and the Alarm is not working at all. i actually found it myself feel extremely uncomfortable situation such as lethargy,Vomiting at last month. At first, i thought
               i'm just so exhausted,but after 2 weeks i feel something is wrong with my air conditioner,so i did the test about the Carbon monoxide content. It was excess.
               For the material, i will catch up by talking with my classmate or maybe tring to ask some help from you if you are available. For right now. i am still dealing with my building
               supervisor and tring to change to a new apartment. i will not miss any classes anymore and try my best to do my project

               Thank you for you understanding.
